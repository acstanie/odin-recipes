        <!-- Directions: How to prepare recipe -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Gather all Ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
                For topping, combine strawberries and jam in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                For cream cheese swirl, combine cream cheese, 3 tablespoons sugar, milk, and vanilla in a small bowl. Beat with 
                an electric mixer until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer cream cheese mixture to a pastry bag or a resealable plastic bag with a corner snipped off. 
            </li>
            <li>
                For pancake batter, combine flour, remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large 
                bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine egg, buttermilk, and oil in a medium bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add egg mixture all at once to the flour mixture. Stir just until moistened (batter should be slightly lumpy).
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat an extra-large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/3 cup portions 
                of batter onto the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook until bottoms are golden brown and edges are slightly dry and bubbles form at the edges of the pancakes, 
                2 to 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pipe a swirl of cream cheese onto each pancake starting from the center.
            </li>
            <li>
                Coat the uncooked side of the pancakes with cooking spray. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn and cook 2 to 3 minutes more on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter and cream cheese mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve with strawberry topping and sprinkle with graham cracker crumbs or dust with powdered sugar.
            </li>
        </ol>
