            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup canned pumpkin</li>
            <li>1/4 cup canola oil</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>

        <!-- Directions on how to prepare recipe -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Whisk flour, sugar, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. 
                Whisk in buttermilk, pumpkin, oil, eggs, and vanilla extract until well blended.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spray a large nonstick griddle or skillet with cooking spray. Heat over medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour batter by scant 1/3 cupfuls into the hot skillet, working in batches. Cook until bubbles form on the 
                surface of pancakes and bottoms are lightly browned, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining 
                batter, spraying the skillet with cooking spray between batches as needed. Serve warm.
